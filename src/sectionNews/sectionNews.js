                <p>Prashanth Neel's KGF, which stars Yash in the lead, has become arguably the most spoken about Kannada film nationally. The expectations have been enormous. Does the team deliver? Yes, they do. The film has a fast-paced first half, which does seem a little long, but the second half and the climax sets up the right premise for the second part of the film.
                The screenplay is the most interesting part of the film. The non-linear pattern keeps the viewers engaged, with the growth of Rocky being shown in a steady fashion. While there are a fair share of scenes and dialogues that bring out the hoots and cheers from the masses, the makers have still maintained a clever story telling pattern that assures one to also keep pace with the narrative. The film traverses from 1951 to 2018, while maintaining a sense of curiosity as each character is unveiled.
                the movie broke all records with collection of 1000cr box-office
